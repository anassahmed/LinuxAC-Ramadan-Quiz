# LinuxAC Ramadan Quiz

A Freelancing project I had worked on with [Linux Arabian Community](http://www.linuxac.org) through [Khamsat](http://www.khamsat.com) back in 2012.

It's basically a small quiz about Open Source and Free Software for 30 days (Obviousy, It's Ramadan Quiz) which targets to increase the fans number of the facebook page (LinuxAC) through a real marketing campaign for who are interested in Free Software.
